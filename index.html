         </p>Both cardio and weights can help you become healthier and more fit. A cardio workout burns more calories than a weight-training workout. However, your metabolism may stay elevated for longer after weights than cardio, and weight lifting is better for building muscle.If you're dieting, weight lifting can help you lose fat instead of muscle and bone. Most people don't realize it, but when they diet, only about 60 to 75 percent of the weight they lose is actually fat. ... That means that if you lift weights, your body will burn calories faster.</p>

                     <p>It's a timeless questions â€“ what's better, cardio or weights? And we get it. You want to feel as if you're working out in the best way to hit your goals, whether they be increasing strength or changing your body composition. So do you need to drip in sweat to see success? Or will heavy lifting help you reach your goals?

                        Rather than prescribe a one-size-fits-all approach, we're going to lay out the facts to help you understand which route is best for you. As a base line the NHS recommends adults do at least 150 minutes of moderate intensity activity a week or 75 minutes of vigorous intensity activity a week as well as 'strengthening activities that work all the major muscles (legs, hips, back, abdomen, chest, shoulders and arms) on at least 2 days a week.'
